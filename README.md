Personal information
====================

This repo might contain information that was not intended to be public. In that case, please open a PR here or send us an email at team at tosdr dot org.

Clone this repository
=====================

There are git submodules in this repository. To automatically have them all, clone this repository with the `git clone --recursive` option.
Alternatively, run `git submodule init` and `git submodule update` to pull in the submodules.

Build
=====
Most of the website's source files are located in the `src/` directory (although unfortunately some of it is still intermingled with the build files). 

To build:

1. Make sure you have the git [submodule](http://www.git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Tools-Submodules) in the `dist/` folder and that it is up-to-date (see above).

    The source files are used to generate the content of the [tosdr.org repository](https://github.com/tosdr/tosdr.org), generated in the `dist/` folder. 

2. Run `npm install` in the root of this repository to make sure you have the required packages.
3. Make the changes you wish to make to the source files in this repository.
4. Run `grunt` or `./node_modules/.bin/grunt` in the root of this repository.
5. Check whether the output in the dist/ directory is looking as intended.
6. Commit and push both repositories.
7. To publish the new version of the website, assuming you have 5apps set up as a remote in the `dist/` folder, run `git push 5apps master`. But be careful: this updates the live site! Ask [@hugoroy] or [@michielbdejong] if you don't have permission

Import
======
To import new and/or updated threads from the Google Group:

* Open [import/bookmarklet.html](https://tosdr.org/import/bookmarklet.html) with Firefox, and follow instructions there; save result to `./import/newThreadSubjects.json` in your checked out local git repo
* Run `node ./import/prettifyNewThreadSubjects.js`
* create `./import/imapCredentials.js` from `./import/imapCredentials.js.sample`
* (from the repo root:) `git pull; npm install ; cd import ; mkdir rawPosts ; cd rawPosts ; node ../searcher.js` (you may have to set 'allow less secure apps' if the imap account is a gmail account).
* `cd .. ; node threadMatcher.js > ../index/threads.json`
* `cd .. ; node scripts/newPointsForNewThreads.js`
* `./node_modules/.bin/grunt`
* `git status ; git add . ; git commit -am"import from Google Groups"; git push; git push 5apps master`

Curate
======
These scripts are what I (Michiel) currently use for curating points after import. The ideas is to integrate these into the web interface:

* `node scripts/curator.js` - will run a curating webinterface on http://localhost:21337/ that lets you change the (local) files on disk
* `cd dist; node ../scripts/checkcases.js` - an interactive command-line tool that helps you assign cases to points that don't have one yet
* `cd dist; node ../scripts/checkclasses.js` - outputs recommendations for adding/updating the class of services, based on their data points
