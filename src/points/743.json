We record this information\r\n        for a limited amount of time […] we sometimes find bugs in the\r\n        systems we’ve built to gather aggregate data on how people are\r\n        interacting with sites that use the Like button or other social\r\n        plugins. It’s helpful to be able to reference this anonymized\r\n        information when investigating these bugs so we can find their\r\n        source and fix them quickly. \""
