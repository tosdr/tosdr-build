    "tldr": "When you visit the website (even if you don't log in), LastPass also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. LastPass does not use such information to identify its visitors. They would also not be allowed to do this by the EU Data Protection Directive, but it's still good that they explicitly state this in their privacy policy."
