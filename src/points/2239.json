This includes service providers/agents (as expected), per user's consent (fine), as required by law (sure), and finally \"When we collaborate with third parties to provide and improve our Services\". This is a bit more shady, as the user doesn't aways know what companies they are collaborating with and is not asked when a new partner comes on board."
