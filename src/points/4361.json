    "case": "You are solely responsible for claims made against the service and agree to indemnify and hold harmless the service.",
    "tldr": "The terms say, \"If you are using our Services on behalf of a business, that business accepts these terms. It will hold harmless and indemnify Tapas Media and its officers, agents, and employees from any claim, suit or action arising from or related to the use of the Services or violation of these terms, including any liability or expense arising from claims, losses, damages, suits, judgments, litigation costs and attorneys' fees.\" In other words, the terms state a business that uses Tapas must leave Tapas out of any legal arguments involving the Terms. I THINK this means that if, let's say, someone is accused of committing a crime using the terms and the business sues them; Tapas in not responsible for this and must be left out of the legal matter."
