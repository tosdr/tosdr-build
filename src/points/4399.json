    "tldr": "The Customer Agreement (EEA) states: \"26.1 We may change this Agreement by giving you at least two (2) monthsâ€™ prior written notice.\"\r\n\r\nHowever there is the following statement: \"26.2 In some instances, we may change this Agreement immediately. Despite section 26.1, changes to this Agreement which are (1) more favourable to you; (2) required by law; or (3) related to the addition of a new service, extra functionality to the existing Service; or (4) changes which neither reduce your rights nor increase your responsibilities, will come into effect immediately if they are stated in the change notice.\"\r\n\r\nThat keeps a loophole to make any changes without notifying users if they make it related to addition of a new service or extra functionality."
