None of this information is associated with any identified person at the time it is collected, but it could potentially be tied to you somehow if we are required to disclose our server logs as a result of a subpoena or other legal process.\" In other words, the policy says slither.io is unable to identify it's players, but its servers could be used to identify them if they are forced to. In my opinion, I do not think this is a bad idea since users are still kept anonymous but their information can be used to solve crimes (possibly a rare situation, but still possible)."
