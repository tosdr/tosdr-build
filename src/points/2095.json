    "tldr": "Tinder uses mobile device IDs (the unique identifier assigned to a device by the manufacturer), or Advertising IDs (for iOS 6 and later), instead of cookies, to recognize you. They do this to store your preferences and track your use of the app. But unlike cookies, device IDs cannot be deleted, so they'll have your device ID forever.  Although they do say that Advertising IDs can be reset in “Settings” on your iPhone. "
