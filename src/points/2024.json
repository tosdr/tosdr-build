    "tldr": "Netflix regularly makes changes to the service, including the content library. In addition, we continually test various aspects of our service, including our website, user interfaces, promotional features and availability of Netflix content. The purpose of this clause is very broad, and there's surely some space for users profiling. You can decide not to take part in this testing features but with an opt-out option."
