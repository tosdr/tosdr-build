        				Terms of service are reviewed by contributors and divided into small points that we can discuss, <a href="topics.html">compare</a> and ultimately assign a score with a badge: <br /><span class="badge badge-success"><i class="icon-thumbs-up icon-white">+</i> Good</span>, <span class="badge badge-warning"><i class="icon-thumbs-down icon-white">-</i> Bad</span>, <span class="badge badge-important"><i class="icon-remove icon-white">×</i> Blocker</span>, or <span class="badge"><i class="icon-arrow-right icon-white">→</i> Neutral</span>.
        			</p>
        			
        			<p>
        				Once a service has enough badges to assess the fairness of their terms for users, a class is assigned automatically by pondering the average scores.
        			</p>
				<p>
					<span class="label A" style="vertical-align:middle">Class A</span> are the best terms of services: they treat you fairly, respect your rights and will not abuse your data.

				<p>
					We get asked alot about how to get rated on tosdr.org and more specifically, how to get a better rating.
				</p>
				<p>
					The best way to understand the process is by heading over to edit.tosdr.org, signing up and doing a little editing yourself. 
					Anyone can sign up as an editor, whose contributions are then checked by a member of the curation team. 
					You can edit your own service, a competitor's one, one that you love or one that you hate - 
					we're not worried about people trying to game the system because nothing goes on tosdr.org if it's not explicitly stated on the actual website in question as verified by a curator.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you're still curious about the categories, cases and the tool the editors work with to rate a service, here's what the editor's tool looks like when when classifying a point*:
				</p>
				<select>

						In most cases, it's fairly easy to see which case would score best, so to get back to the original question: 
					</p>
					<p>
						If you want a better rating on tosdr.org, all you have to do is go through every every line in your ToS and make sure it would have the most favourable case applied to it.
					</p>
					<p>			
						Easy, huh?
					</p>
					</p>
						* This list is ever-evolving and may not be exactly the same in practice as the example you see here.

				<p>
					Right now, you will notice that not many services have a class assigned. That is because we need more data and more reviews before we can start assigning them. Moreover, we are still experimenting with how to apply classes.
